Bulbasaur is the superior starter pokemon. Ever since Red from Pokespe picked bulbasaur and immediately made it use solar beam, you could see the instant connection between the two. Bulbasaur supremacy! His vines can entrap you and leech your life, his powder can poison you, and his bulb can launch a solar beam. Saur is also the most wholesome and most majestic. 




an incoherent tribute to our brotherhood and guild:

 Zain our compass. Ata our laughter. Yarah our jinn. Malaz our wisdom. Aki our noble. Mehdi, our scribe. Stane our healer. Wunna our hater. Alu our strange vampire poet. Finally, Vay, our Canvas.
