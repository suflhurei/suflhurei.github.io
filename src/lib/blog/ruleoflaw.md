author: Zen Ghurkan
date: 2024-04-27
description: The west claims to have ascended past the days of scholasticism and the backwardness of the Church - they have slaughtered divinity. But have they? Objective Morality persists, the Western church is rebranded, the neo-kings reign supreme and the Eastern Barbarian frightens us all. God has been replaced.

To be Published: 

This work will likely consist of a series of articles seperated into chapters. I am currently in the process of writing it down. The name is a placeholder for now, and is subject to change. This work is an expression of internal musings following years of reading about civilisation, history, politics, anthropology, and my abundance of knowledge from personal experiences in life and interacting with people akin to geniuses. 

For now, I will post my layout and my introduction. If the work ends up becoming too long, I may very well attempt to write it as a book and potentially get it published. This will be wildly imperfect due to some formatting errors still present in the site, but enjoy for the time being <3

**INTRODUCTION STARTS HERE:**

In our current era, our enlightened society has liberated itself from the oppressive clutches of the Church. It is 2024, and our moral compass is no longer dictated by intrusive Priests, archaic Scholasticism, or mandatory Church service. We have emancipated ourselves from Papal despotism and the Gospels. The prophecy of Liberté has been fulfilled - we are finally free. Our enlightened society has slaughtered divinity and eradicated subserviency to enforced morality. Our modern ethics stands firm and proud. It is decided by enlightened and free individuals, beholden to each other and to “humanity”. We hold each other to account through universal morals, guided by ethical philosophy and ideals such as individual freedoms and the liberal nature of man, upheld by the sanctity of the Law. Our commitment to the Law is unwavering, it lays the basis of our sociality and encompasses our relationship with our fellow humans, and society at large.

In the pursuit of justice and a free and fair society, we rely on the constitutions of our nation state, emboldened by the legitimacy and consent of our free people, despite its occasionally fluid and bipolar borders. We are bound by the Law, it is not only sacred but it is an icon of our peoples claim to civilization, serving as a bulwark to barbarism. Adherence to our revered Laws provides us with stability, safety and prosperity. Our legal canon terraforms our unruly society into a flourishing garden, quite unlike the ruly barbarians, frolicking in their untamed jungles. Logically, primitive societies must also have their own legal systems and sacred constitutions. However, it is evident that their current systems are wholly lacking. While we do not wish for their prosperity to usurp ours, we recognise the necessity to maintain our hegemony and supremacy. If they were to follow their native systems, we would be forced to contend with their culture and laws. Naturally, our way of life is superior, but what if their native systems did succeed? If they did, it would lead to radical doubt over the sanctity and supremacy of our own civilization. Instead, we will coerce them to adopt a rigged version of our sacred systems, a cheap copy and paste, subservient to our own. Their inevitable failure in manoeuvring our supreme and complex system can be blamed on their inherent barbarity and rejection of sacred laws that only we can comprehend. In summary, our modern Western society champions universalist morality, a superior legal system and ethical philosophy, distinct from the oppressive divinity of the Church, and from the primitive barbarians.

It is in this way that the West sees itself, elevated from barbarism and the shackles of divinity. The purpose of this work is to practically and philosophically illustrate that the West has not wholesale “slaughtered divinity”. In fact, it has replaced it with a form of “neo-divinity”, persisting in old structures. The West's interaction with the world is full of odes to divinity and divine expansion, in the field of law, morality and culture. The concept of the slaughter of divinity is synonymous with the fall of objective morality which is guided by holy texts and Godhood. However, the new, so-called subjective morals are surprisingly objective and religious in nature. Objective morality has been replaced with universal morality, legal and social systems that should be adopted by all backwards peoples. The concept of universalism is inherently expansionist, it rejects Divine morality and equates world systems with ethical philosophy insisting on the rights of man, decided by man. My pressing question is - what men? Which men decided upon these principles, and for what men were they created. The answer to this question is intrinsically linked to the evolution of Divine law and secular law since the inception of the Roman Republic - the originator of Western legal tradition. To substantiate the neo-divinity of the West, we must first explore when the West was divine and when it was not divine. A holistic analysis of divinity in the west must rest on a dual discipline of history. A historical account that is both linear and cyclical will be utilised to come to a satisfactory conclusion on what neo-divinity entails for the west. 

The first arc of my work will be titled: The Enlightened Slaughter Divinity - A Cyclical Chronicle. This arc serves as a prologos (prologue) to the next two arcs. First, a historical account of divine and neo-divine law will take place, promulgating from the Roman Republic and the The Laws of the Twelve Tables (lex duodecim tabularum). Following this, an account of the west’s adoption to Christianity and the supremacy of Christian Divine Law, spread by the clergy and “divinely appointed monarchs” will take place. This Arc will conclude by exploring the destruction of the Church, and therefore the slaughter of the divine via the pen and the sword - the enlightenment and the French revolution.

The second arc of my work will be titled “The Enlightened Perceive of Neo-Divinity”. It will explain the death and resurrection of the Divine. Entrenched in the post-Divine world was a divinity shrouded in secularism. The slogan “liberté, égalité, fraternité” itself was an immediate expression of the rebirth of divinity. The death of the Church in Europe was immediately replaced with neo-divinity in ethical philosophy and law. This time, it was affirmed most resolutely by the rising nation state - a new form of nationhood encompassing citizenship, national identity and constitutions. The section on “Our Pristine Aesthetic” will blend modern culture, art and identity to conclude that crypto-divinity is entrenched in an enlightened nation through subtler means. The resurrection of the Divine Right of Kings will also be covered considering its relevance.

The final arc of my work will be titled “And It All Comes Tumbling Down”. The established order is undergoing a profound transformation. International and internal perceptions of neo-divinity have been eroded by trouble in the holy land (The Palestinian Conflict). The mask is finally cracking, and the new neo-divine experiment seems to be tumbling down. The Western world is tussling with the demonisation of its pristine aesthetic. Grappling with the rise of the barbarian from the occident, the proponents of neo-divinity end up cannibalising each other. A comparison will be made between the modern West, the Romans, and the Church, but it will not rely on one-to-one rhetorical poetry. As previously mentioned, the discipline of history and civilisation is both cyclical and linear and both will be taken into account. The Eastern Barbarian consists of two groups - the Chinese state and the Islamic Ummah (community), both will be explored in relation to divinity, the law, and their relation to Western neo-divinity.
