title: Law and Divinity - Rebranding the Holy and the Eastern Menace
author: Zen Ghurkan
date: 2024-04-27
description: The west claims to have ascended past the days of scholasticism and the backwardness of the Church - they have slaughtered divinity. But have they? Objective Morality persists, the Western church is rebranded, the neo-kings reign supreme and the Eastern Barbarian frightens us all. God has been replaced.
