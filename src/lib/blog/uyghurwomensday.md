As the world observes International Women’s Day, our attention is drawn to the inspirational stories and achievements of gender equality advocates worldwide. We marvel at powerful women's accomplishments, affirming their capabilities and contribution to the world without geographic constraints. We are reminded of and celebrate international and grassroots movements aimed at empowering women. Yet, amidst these commemorations, ongoing atrocities are being committed against women in East Turkestan (commonly referred to as the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China). Harrowing tales of abuse faced by lucky survivors are frequent and consistent, and leaked documents affirm these stories. The struggles of Uyghur women give a stark reminder to the world that international women's day is not solely about commemorating the past, but striving to help the status of women in the present and future.


The situation in East Turkestan operates in contrast to debates regarding reproductive rights in the West. Discussions in the United States and other Western states frequently focus on the right to choose not to have children, while Uyghur women have their right to choose to have children brutally denied. The Chinese government has embarked on a systematic campaign of forced intrusion to decrease the Uyghur birthrate and prevent Uyghur women from having children. Reports of forced abortions, sterilizations, and sexual assault have been outlined by a variety of credible sources, all of which highlight grave human rights violations and assaults on the freedom and dignity of Uyghur women.


It is necessary to approach China’s restrictions against Uyghur women with a bipartisan lens. We must recognize that the defense of universal human rights transcends political divides. This is not a matter of partisanship, but a dedication to universal human rights - the very principles upon which the United States and the international community were founded. Both conservatives and liberals can find common ground in advocating for the rights and freedoms of Uyghur women in a practical manner. Bipartisan efforts supporting the rights of the oppressed are common in history. America and other Western nations have recently united in denouncing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and there is nothing stopping the West from once again uniting to protect the rights of Uyghur women.


Drawing parallels with history, the situation in East Turkestan echoes the Soviet Union’s approach towards Turkic Muslim women in Central Asia. The USSR’s propaganda apparatus, embellished by its use of obscene posters showcasing Muslim women, boasted about liberating Turkic Muslim women from “tyrannical backward Muslim rule”, which masked the harsh realities of oppression and the suppression of religious freedoms in Central Asia. Similarly, recent tweets posted by the Chinese authorities make claims that abortions and labor are “liberating” Uyghur women. Such claims must be scrutinized and challenged; these assertions aim to mask the true nature of these actions, which are, in actuality, conceited forms of coercion and violence against women.



This comparison with the USSR serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of international groups in addressing and opposing public and obvious injustices, disregarding where they occur. If the international community and all sides of the US political spectrum could rightfully criticize the USSR’s violation of human rights, it is incumbent upon us to apply the same standards on China, especially concerning Uyghur women..



In addressing the oppression of Uyghur women in East Turkestan, it is essential to recognize the patriarchal structure of the Chinese government, which is predominantly run by men. A United Nations report highlighted concerns about the absence of women in China’s top political roles, noting that there had been no women among the 24 members of the CCP’s politburo since October 2022.This male-dominated leadership exposes a hypocritical stance on “liberating” Uyghur women. On the one hand, China brazenly advertises forced abortions and sterilizations as being “progressive”, yet its politburo does not include any women. It is a common case of men speaking for women. 


The crux of this issue is the fundamental right to choose and to freely decide on matters relating to one’s own body and future. This right transcends borders, cultures, and nation states - it is universal and inherent to all human beings. It is a right that should be shielded and championed for every woman, regardless of her ethnicity, religion, or culture. The plight of Uyghur women is a grave reminder that the global fight for women’s freedoms and rights is ever continuous. 

In conclusion, as we celebrate International Women's day, let us make a commitment to remember the struggles of Uyghur women in East Turkestan. Their fight is a testament to the ongoing struggle for women’s rights across the globe. International women’s day should not only be a day of celebration, but one of action. Let this be a day of reflection, action, and unity, where we learn about the oppression of women throughout history, apply these lessons to the present, and use them to help the fate of Uyghur women.
